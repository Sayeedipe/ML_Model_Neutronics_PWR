  Machine-Learning Model for Neutronic Analyses of 17X17 Pressurized Water Reactor Fuel Assemblies


Three machine-learning (ML) models were developed for predicting two important neutronic parameters, neutron multiplication factor (K∞) and void coefficient (αv), of 17×17 pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assemblies.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model: ANN model with 6-10-10-2 architecture demonstrated superior prediction. The "Best_Fit_ANN.m" code can be utilized to calculate two important neutronics parameters at specific material compositions. 

The source code for GPR and SVR are also given for comparative analysis.
