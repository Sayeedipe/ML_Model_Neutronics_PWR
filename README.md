  Machine-Learning Model for Neutronic Analyses of 17X17 Pressurised Water Reactor Fuel Assemblies


Three machine-learning (ML) models were developed to predict two important neutronic parameters, the neutron multiplication factor (K∞) and the void coefficient (αv), of 17×17 pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assemblies.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model: The ANN model with a 6-15-15-2 architecture demonstrated superior prediction. The "Best_Fit_ANN.m" code can be utilised to calculate two important neutronics parameters at specific material compositions.
